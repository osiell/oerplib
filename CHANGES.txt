v0.5.1, 2012-05-09:
    Bug fixes:
    - Able to assign the 'False' value to a field of type 'char' for
      a browse record.

v0.5.0, 2012-04-03:
    - Access to all methods proposed by an OSV class (even ``browse``) with an
      API similar to that can be found in OpenERP server,
    - Access to several browse records improved (no need to wait the
      instanciation of all records to iterate on them),
    - Documentation updated.

v0.4.0, 2012-03-23:
    - Net-RPC protocol support added
    - Database management (via the 'OERP.db' attribute)
    - Browse records are no longer stored in OERPLib, each call to the 'browse',
      method will generate a new instance
    - Methods which need a user connected raise an exception
      if it is not the case
    - Browse records now store their own original data and fields updated in
      the '__data__' attribute
    - Browse record classes now store their metadata (OSV class name and
      columns) in the '__osv__' attribute
    - Dictionary interface of the 'OERP' class dropped,
    - 'write' and 'unlink' methods don't handle browse records anymore,
      'write_record' and 'unlink_record' added for this purpose
    - Unit tests added
    - A new design for the documentation

    Bug fixes:
    - 'name' attribute of a browse record fixed (does not rely on the 'name_get'
      OSV method anymore)
    - 'OERP.report' method (previously called 'OERP.exec_report') works well,
    - 'None' values can now be sent via the XML-RPC protocol

    Other:
    - Project migrated from Bitbucket to Launchpad

    - ID field of browsable objects is readonly

      deprecated browsable objects
    - String representation of browsable objects is of the form
      "browse_record('sale.order', 42)" (like OpenERP Server)
    - Implicit management of the 'name_get' method for browsable objects
    - 'join' parameter of the 'OERP.browse' method has been deleted
    - 'refresh' option of the 'OERP.browse' method is set to True by default
